# Future-Nostalgia
This is my first ever project, and I'm gonna be learning as I do stuff. This is a lot, and I'm already really overstimulated, but I'm even more excited!
I'm working towards building a mod for Minecraft: Java Edition in which you can select an area and essentially lock textures and shaders to it almost like a custom biome!
I'm starting with a proof-of-concept that's mostly just texture changes. This is going to be a very learn-as-I-go project. I've never coded anything before, but I've taken up a HUGE interest!
We shall see where this ends up! :)
